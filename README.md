# skeleton-based action recognition
this is my first time to try on the deeplearning & tensorflow & action recognition. 
so, please notice that the code is still dirty. 
i have put some ckpt here to ensure the performance of the method.
also, u can train the model all by yourself.
ten seconds training time is enough in my desktop. 
have a good hacking time! 

#TODO list
- the UTN-D.  
- ckpt (finished)
