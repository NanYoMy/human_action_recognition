# skeleton-based action recognition
this is my first time to try on the deeplearning & tensorflow & action recognition. 
so, please notice that the code is still dirty. 
i didn't have any pretrain model here.
because u can train the model all by yourself.
ten seconds is enough in my desktop. 
have a good hacking time!
