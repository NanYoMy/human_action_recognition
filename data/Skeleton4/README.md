# pyNTURGB-D

A python interface to work with the NTURGB-D dataset by shahroudy.

If you wan't to use this project you have to do the following:

  -> install python3 ( Anaconda or something )
  
  -> install numpy ( pip3 -install numpy )
  
  -> install bresenham ( pip3 -install bresenham )
  
  -> create a folder and add all the files of the project
  
  -> create the following subfolder: 
  
        -> data ( actually only for the masked depth files )
        
        -> skeleton
  
  -> download the Dataset: https://github.com/shahroudy/NTURGB-D
  
  -> distribute the files from the dataset to the previously created folders ( skeleton & data )
  
  -> open a terminal and switch to the project then type: ./ppe -h 
  
  -> read the description for further information
  
Loading the RGB data and the unmasked Depth files isn't actually part of the project but will follow.

Cheers
